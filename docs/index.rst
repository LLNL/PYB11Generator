PYB11Generator's documentation
==============================

PYB11Generator is a python based code generator that creates `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ code for binding C++ libraries as extensions in Python. PYB11Generator parses input that is very close to writing the desired interface in native python, turning this into the corresponding pybind11 C++ code.

.. Note::

   Since PYB11Generator blindly generates C++ pybind11 code, it is essential to understand the pybind11 package itself as well!  In other words, be sure to read and understand the `pybind11 documentation <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ before trying to go too far with PYB11Generator.  The purpose of PYB11Generator is to reduce the burden of writing and maintaining redundant code when working with pybind11 (such as the trampoline classes required by :ref:`pybind11:overriding_virtuals`), and provide a natural syntax for those already familiar with writing interfaces in Python.  However, since the generated pybind11 code produced by PYB11Generator is what is actually compiled by a C++ compiler to create the corresponding python package, any errors reported by the compiler will refer to this generated code, and require understanding pybind11 itself to properly interpret.

An important caveat about Python versions
-----------------------------------------

As currently implemented, PYB11Generator assumes Python 2, and will not work with Python 3 input syntax.  This is due to the fact PYB11Generator grew from an internal utility in the `Spheral <https://github.com/jmikeowen/spheral>`_ astrophysics modeling project, which uses Python 2.* syntax for backwards compatability with Spheral work that predates the existence of Python 3.  The generated pybind11 code itself is not restricted to Python 2 however, so the generated modules should be compatible with Python 2 or 3 -- only the input files to PYB11Generator need to be in Python 2 syntax.
